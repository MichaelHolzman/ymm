#summary Leak detection

= General Desription =

YAMM provides a very simple memory leak detection ability. After each memory block allocating, the block size and pointer are stored in the file named {{{yamm_leak.dat}}}. The file is located on the current work directory. This file is processed later by the {{{yamm_leak_report}}} application. The report application does not require command line parameters. It looks for the {{{yamm_leak.dat}}} file in the current working directory and produces a report if the file is found.

Leak report contains messages of two types. The first type named _*'Potential memory leak'*_. An error of this type means that several allocations were done at this point of code but not all of them were freed. 

The second error type is _*'Memory leak'*_. An error of this type means a pure memory leak: some space were allocated at this point of code and never released.



= Configuration for Leak Detection =

The memory leak monitoring is controlled by two variables set in {{{yamm_tune.c}}} (see [tune tuning]):

{{{extern hrtime_t yamm_leak_check_start_time = 2;
extern hrtime_t yamm_leak_check_stop_time = 150;}}}

The first variable says when to start monitoring. It is the time (in seconds) from the application start. The latter defines when to stop monitoring. In the example above the monitoring will start two seconds after the invocation and will stop 148 seconds afterwards (150 seconds from the beginning). 

A negative value of {{{yamm_leak_check_start_time}}} disables the monitoring.
