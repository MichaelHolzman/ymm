#summary Leaks finding

= General Desription =

YAMM provides a very simple memory leak detection ability. After each memory block allocating, the block size and pointer are stored in the file named {{{yamm_leak.dat}}}. The file is located on the current work directory. This file is processed later by the {{{yamm_leak_report}}} application. The report application does not require command line parameters. It looks for the {{{yamm_leak.dat}}} file in the current working directory and produces a report if the file is found.

Leak report contains messages of two types. The first type named _*'Potential memory leak'*_. An error of this type means that several allocations were done at this point of code but not all of them were freed. 

The second error type is _*'Memory leak'*_. An error of this type means a pure memory leak: some space were allocated at this point of code and never released.
